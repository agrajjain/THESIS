				I would like to thank Professor Farshad Khorrami for his advisement during the course of this project, as well as his invaluable guidance throughout my masters program which enabled me to focus on control and robotics. The in depth conceptual understanding of various aspects of building a robot has given me valuable experience and insight for which I am grateful.

				I would also like to thank Dr. Krishnamurthy for his guidance and insights about various aspects of implementing the algorithms which enabled me to move forward whenever I was stuck. I would also like to thank my colleagues Griswald Brooks and Alaina Herkelman for helping in the construction of the testing platform and design of the data acquisition process.
