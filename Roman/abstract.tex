This thesis provides the implementation and testing of feature extraction algorithms for \ekf based indoor \slam on a dedicated integrated mobile platform. The thesis details the concepts behind EKF and it's application to SLAM. The features of the mobile platform and it's suitability to act as a testing platform for SLAM is discussed. A simple point feature extraction algorithm is discussed along with it's results and drawbacks. Two linear feature extraction algorithms are discussed, both conceptually and practically. The algorithms discussed are plugged into the SLAM algorithm to gain insights about their effectiveness and robustness. The testing is done in both controlled and uncontrolled indoor environments and the results are analyzed
